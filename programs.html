                       The Girls Club was set up set up in 2023 when we discovered the need to pay more attention to Girls within the communities we serve.
We noticed that more girls were dropping out of school and they could not make other healthy life choices.
We gather them monthly to mentor and encourage them. They are also provided opportunity to engage in apprenticeship as well as receiving training for hands-on skills acquisition.
This Club seeks to bridge the gaps that exist in modeling an inspiring and focused future for our Girls.
Menstrual and Personal Health Hygiene is also largely focused on at our monthly meetings where menstrual and hygiene packs are distributed.

                    <p class="program-description">
                        We started this quarterly intervention in 2017 and it has really been helpful in alleviating healthcare poverty among the vulnerable communities where we work.
Medical Personnel and Drugs are taken to Communities where they offer counseling, diagnosis and dispense the drugs.
Common ailments of malaria, cold, cough, infections, pains are prevalent among these groups of people.

                    <p class="program-description">
                     For other cases, they are encouraged to visit the hospital and not involve in self medication.
At the beginning of the School Term, we carry out deworming exercise for school pupils and counsel on diet and hygiene.

We visit selected Communities and engage their Leaders, Parents, Teachers and Children on the importance of Education and the need to ensure that no one is left behind.
Attention is given also to providing learning materials to children.

Education is indeed the tool for change and transform. We have been commemorating this Day since 2021 to alleviate the impact of Covid-19 on Education as the post-Covid -19 effect was a massive drop out of school in many rural communities who had no access to technology.

                     The peculiarities of the challenges faced by girls must be given adequate attention. Sadly, girls development and growth are still undermined in many quarters while they are saddled at a young age with responsibilities weighing down on their capacity.
We take time to celebrate Girls and those role models amongst them who are breaking barriers and against all odds are forging ahead.

                      The Day is spent to renew their mindset to be more determined, resilient and focused while making life choices.
The World indeed will be a better place when inclusivity commences early.
Commemoration of this Day began in 2017 when we brought to the fore the need for the Social Protection of the Girl Child.
